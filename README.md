# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I created a webpage that functions as a study guide for the prework of the coding bootcamp I am in.

- I built this project to have all my notes in one place
- I learned how to use git, github, html, css, and javascript in making this webpage

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains information about certain topics: html, css, javascript.
If you open devtools, you can see the javascrips running in the console. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
